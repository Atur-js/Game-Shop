                                    <p>Fans of the well-established cybernetic franchise can rejoice! Watch Dogs are back with a bang – or rather, a very clandestine whisper of revolution. Buy Watch Dogs: Legion key and step into the streets of a futuristic London, gather a crew of trusted companions (or pawns in your plans) and take the city back! Revolution might be an ancient concept, but now it’s time to make it viral.</p>

                                    <h5>Endless cast</h5>

                                    <p>Do you remember the time when having 10 companions seem a lot and even excessive? Well, try having the whole city as a potential team! The game boasts with the ability to recruit any and all people on the street. Therefore, if you ever wanted to save the world with a team of geeks and misfits, buy Watch Dogs: Legion key and go nuts! Or perhaps proving the superiority of the noble minds is more your style? Well, the characters you recruit all have their own skills and motivations, making their part in the revolution truly unique.</p>

                                    <h5>Characters to recruit</h5>

                                    <p>Recruited characters are assigned into one of three classes, each with different gameplay. These would be combat, stealth, and hacking, so be sure to use your characters in the appropriate setting. And remember, while you can seamlessly switch from one to another, your characters can also die. And it’s permanent, which means you lose an asset. So, buy Watch Dogs: Legion key, make smart decisions do not take on more than you can conquer and be sure to utilize your people to the best of their ability.</p>

                                    <h5>Customize your way to victory</h5>

                                    <p>Freedom and liberty aren’t only the themes of the game; they also seep into the game’s mechanics. You can alter your appearance, your companions’ appearance and once you get enough of playing dress-up, take a look at the abilities and improvements each of them can receive. These will determine how best to proceed, as you probably will not leave a stealth mission to a brute with neon-pink hair… then again, once you buy Watch Dogs: Legion key, you can do anything within the city! Just remember to deal with the aftermath.</p>

                                    <h5>Route to liberation</h5>

                                    <p>Literally any route you pick to liberate London is suitable. Choose what missions to take on, which people to recruit and how silent or how loud you want to be in your endeavors. Hack the city’s robotic force and turn it against oppressors, blow up few buildings to establish your dominance or just silently and systematically eliminate those in your way. Work till you drop – or till the city is yours. They won’t remember how you got there, only what you accomplished.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
